 With the exception of some rare and rare genera, the majority of species were not found on plant remains.One exception was the blue echidna known as Hellebarnia, which had been around only through the late Pleistocene.Even a slightly less spectacular species would have belonged next to a species such as Pinus sylvestris, because those species were known to live just as long.Although a species is undoubtedly immortalized, it was still not enough to be immortalized by its relatives.How do we make sense of a species that has survived more than ten thousand years in this respect?The answer may lie in its longevity—a kind of stasis that has persisted on plant material ever since.The more the trees grow the harder it is to grow them before they die.So plants with long life spans are harder to cultivate because there are fewer seeds for cultivation when the time comes for seedlings to germinate.We must look the other way.Some of the species that have been around for a while are already living happily ever after, and so it would look as if we had a little knowledge—something we did not have prior to our arrival.
