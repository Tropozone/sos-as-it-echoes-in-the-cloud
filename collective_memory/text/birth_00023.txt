 The question becomes: do we have an ethical obligation to acknowledge the existence of the beast and to be part of it?We are all part of the same big beast, and yet we must have a stake in its demise.We are all part of this big beast too; letâ€™s keep it going forever.There is nothing wrong with having a clear vision of the future.I love that idea.But there are lots of things we need to care about, and I want no part of them.This essay is a call to re-evaluate our attitudes toward certain parts of animal life that are in conflict with one another.It is a calling to be the other person, to be the other in.And I am doing it right.These essays take me back to the roots of animal activism in a time of the Cold War.I am not writing about all of them; the question I am trying to answer is, how might one respond to them.I am writing about the ways that we humans have been drawn to them, and what a world we need to exist.The concept of a good being is not what I am talking about here.I am only using one term; the idea of the good being that comes along with being here is what I intend to include here in this volume.
