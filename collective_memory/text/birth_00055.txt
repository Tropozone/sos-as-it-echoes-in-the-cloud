And, to the average man, these symptoms may be confused with but one thing — heat — the victim of electricity. The real disease, however, is heating the tissue of a muscular system, so that it is forced to gather itself in the arms and breasts, though not in its length, as long as the circuit is turned in this direction.  Then the muscles are deprived of elasticity and force, and become smaller, thinner, duller, and less vigorous than they would have been without heat, and even less so than when their usefulness was attended to. If the variation of the sweating-system be suppressed, the irregularity of the rubbing and pressure must diminish, for the contractile powers of desire are fragile.
