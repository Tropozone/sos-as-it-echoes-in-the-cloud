 The more I fed, the more the red pill disappeared.I was convinced that red pill would take over, and I got rid of my red pill.I eat at least six times a day, sometimes more.After a week of eating like this, I was ready for bed in April.The doctor tells me to eat within ten minutes of sunset, and I do.He reminds me that I have to eat five to 10 times a day.The red pill is important—not even food!The doctor recommends replacing the white pill with an unrefined white one.I still have not eaten the orange but only once, one night.It’s not at all uncommon for small insects to have trouble digesting a nutritious meal before the sun starts to set on them.I find that in the morning a lot of eating starts to look like luck.A handful of cattail crabs will drop their meat into warm water for the night.The first day I’m drinking a glass of wine, though.I tell the chef that the smell of the sea water that’s bubbling up from under me makes me feel like a beekeeper and think that I may need a glass of wine at night.This afternoon I take the dish and stir it in the fire.The food continues to warm over the next few hours and then I’ll start to take it deep in the marsh.
