 Let me go further, and tell a story of great diversity.And the story is more than one.Its history is a history of struggle and resistance.The idea that the people are the oppressors of me was never a possibility for me.From a deep wound in my heart, I found myself torn between a love of my land and a fear of the beast.And I am afraid to open my eyes.The land was once my home, but there was still a great stain on its back.And I am afraid to think that I have ever been the one to tell the stories of loss.This is where I want to begin.A tale is told by the people, stories they tell themselves.And I want to follow them.Now it is time for the people to hear that story aloud.They will tell it to their elders, to their sons and daughters.And I will tell of the days when trees are in their place, when the wind blows.The wind is a mighty blow against the ground, and the wind is strong against the people.And I will carry what I have made home as an inheritance to generations to come.Let me go on, on the road with the wind.The path I have always walked will make an entrance to this land and all the others.The trees will hear that the word of this people.Now we will live together.The people will hear the message in their hearts as if it were a pledge of friendship.So let no other tree take the path and bring in what is given in return.The people know that the gift of the tree is a weapon.The tree is the shield of the shield of the people.A language woven with our story.A language of our land makes us know how to tell a story.The people of the land hear our song together.They sing a language of our memory.But I am speaking and speaking together only as I say it.
