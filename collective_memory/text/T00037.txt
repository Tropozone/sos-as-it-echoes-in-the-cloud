 Forest is not only the forest of the woods; it is also the forest of the garden.This is a forest of diversity and possibilities for both human and nonhuman action.The forest has changed tremendously over the last forty years, but this does not mean that everything is the same for it.There are many different parts to the forest.Itâ€™s not just the trees and the plants that are changing, but it has also created and shaped it.These changes are the result of the transformations of both human and nonhuman beings.So there are all these different parts of me.Some things are happening together, while others are happening outside.To see forests and forests as objects, consider how they are moving across boundaries, like the difference between an object and its environment.
