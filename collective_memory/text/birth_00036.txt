 Changes in soil fertility can affect the degree of nitrogen fixation at the root end of the plant, and changes in root endophyte viability are thus important determinants of the probability of a given species occurrence or occurrence in the tropics.The results of these two studies suggest that plant community structure is strongly influenced by soil biota.Therefore, the question as to the root endophyte viability that is important for plant populations to develop in wet or sandy habitats is addressed.As the latter question requires less information regarding root endophyte viability, the answer to the latter requires careful consideration of community biology.How Is Vegetation Fungi Symbiotic or Functional?In its simplest form, fungi have no physiological role to play in plant community structure.Most natural fungi have either limited ability to maintain themselves in a substrate by decomposition or do not survive in moist habitat.If the plant community is too infertile for fungi to provide the nutrients needed to make the necessary growth, the environment becomes unstable or the community eventually gets out of whack.There is usually little or no fungal growth at all.However, fungal growth can take a considerable amount of time when soil biota are in flux, or when the host must establish a high tolerance to nutrients and are limited by the available air.Thus, fungi can benefit greatly from grazing by removing pathogens as well as providing a food source by reducing air pollutant loads.In addition, grazers might benefit from improving nitrogen dynamics by reducing nitrogen content or by stimulating grass decomposition.
