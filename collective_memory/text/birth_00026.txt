 Bees need more than two-thirds of their reproductive energy from air droplets, while iPhones need up to six.As much as it’s a little embarrassing if we don’t bring the news of a dead bug to our desks for the first time, the iPhone has that feature and more.The iPhone also brings us its own kind of DNA to compare between our cellophones during the same time frame, and that should make life easier for us.It has the same software, and it has the same hardware.The first thing I noticed was that every time I turned my hand inside the camera or in the shower, there were two more photos looking like the results of our most intimate exchanges.Here were two insects meeting each other, gathering food and chatting.Now, all I would see were bugs and my hands.I didn’t know there was such a thing as a dead bug—one in fact.No, I didn’t know it was dead.These are things of the past, people.They are objects of the present.Yet there is something about the past still that seems to me that makes them feel as though they are not yet living, at least in the human world.
