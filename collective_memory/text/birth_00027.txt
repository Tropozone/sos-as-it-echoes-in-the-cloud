 We donâ€™t just live forever; life stops and we leave behind the life of a tiny clump of matter that will grow and spread all around us.But where do the small particles arrive and start growing?What happens when the life cycles of a new population of organisms come together around them and cause new problems?That is, how quickly do we know the answers to these questions and how quickly might we make adjustments?And sometimes a species becomes perfect in the meantime.Because for many species it is very long and hard to find a place for a protein molecule.When it encounters a new protein, it is very hard to find a replacement.If the amino acid we have discovered is not found in a molecule that we are looking for, it is very hard to find a protein in which it has already been expressed.It depends on the size and composition of the proteins and also the size of the host.
