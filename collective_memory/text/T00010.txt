 At the time, dinosaurs were just beginning to take on a life of their own.A lot of time for the scientific community to dedicate to improving the life and capabilities of dinosaurs was coming before this new year arrived; most of the scientific papers just came out the next year.The last dinosaurs were found in a very recent amber deposit in Madagascar, on the banks of the Yellow River.One study showed that the deposits date back to the Cambrian, a time when the sea floor was very warm enough to support animals.Although fossils had been discovered, there was still no indication that there was anything special going on.When you look deeply, nothing suggests that you may have seen the last of these creatures.Did they have a kind of long and sharp tooth?The paleo-girdosaur fossil record tells a different story.But those early discoveries about the fossilised remains of this group are worth a thoroughgoing look.Most other animals looked fairly different, from large carnivores to small carnivorous cephalopod dinosaurs.I was surprised to learn that the most obvious differences were the eyes.These animals were not dinosaurs at all, and had a lot of jawbone.
