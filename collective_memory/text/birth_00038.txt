 We know how things looked like after the Romans left.The Sphinx was made from sand, yet it is still the most beautiful building in Egypt, still the most beautiful on earth.It’s still going to be built, it is still beautiful and it is still powerful.There’s plenty of room left in the city.I want to die.But I don’t want to die alone.The Sphinx is still here.It hasn’t left much time; it is still there.Our bodies take up more and more matter, but we never really leave behind the building material.The Sphinx is still going to happen.And then we are.When will it stop?It doesn’t matter.No one will touch the building, there will always be more materials and time to build.All the way from the earliest times to antiquity, our minds have been thinking of the Sphinx as an extension of the heart, the door that opens in the right hand—the door to life.At the outset, it would seem there is no need to make an effort to connect with a living heart.Instead we should simply make an effort to love with the stone and move on.Perhaps the most beautiful piece of human architecture, the Sphinx came to symbolize the human spirit in its most intimate and sacred place in the land.The Sphinx is the gateway to humanity.The Sphinx is the heart.The Sphinx is the temple.A Sphinx temple is an animal temple, an animal city.The Sphinx sits atop the great tree of life in the garden of this little mountain.Its exterior is a garden whose beauty and its mystery can never be found without its creator.
