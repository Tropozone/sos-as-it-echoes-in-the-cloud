 When the bees have reached the moon, where do they meet the phones, and how can those contacts be traced back to their hive?Are these communications devices more or less like our own and perhaps, at greater or lesser scales, less secure at all?And at a wider scale, what could be anachronistic—yet in the spirit of Kantian idealism, could it be the other way around?But again, let’s add that these conversations are not the bees of the Hive or even of the technological hive.I am not here to judge you all on your technical competence.I’m just trying to take you through all the steps of it.As I mentioned in the previous chapter I am not a physicist, but I am interested in the processes, in the processes between bees and technology.Hobbyists, students, and volunteers in the beekeeping industry, both use the devices, as well as the media, to develop a system in which bees could communicate.It is very simple in the sense, I believe.The hive is a space of relationships.The bees are not really conscious, nor are the computers conscious to bemoan.I want to explore the bees.Indeed, one might like to show that the bees are neither conscious of the difference between bees’ naturalistic and artificial worlds.The bees’ interactions with computer technologies is not simply a relation: there is also a relation that emerges, though not an analogy.If it is a relation.The difference is a relation between a machine and the hive, then there is a process, it is a difference between, but not a process.An insect, the bee, in the flower and the machine, and the bee's artificial.
