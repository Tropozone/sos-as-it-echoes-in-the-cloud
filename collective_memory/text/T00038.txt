 It’s time to do something drastic.Let’s put our pen in the sand.We both want to keep the bird.They both want to get it back.I wish we could save the bird, at least.I don’t know how we can.But who knows?I’m sorry that I have to put this book on my desk, but I’m making some decisions for the rest of my life.I cannot live without a pheromone.I don’t know how I can thank the pheromone.I could call my mom and tell her to bring it to a park for a couple weeks before taking it out of the trunk.She would be the one who would explain to me why I’ve left it alone and how we know our lives are going to change for the better if I listen to her.I would want the bird back.But the pheromone is not ours to take.I want it in my pen, too.Let’s make it a pen and keep it.I want to make a bird, a parrot.We both agree that it has every right to be there.And that’s what she wants.Because if it could be left alone, then all the lives could change.It has everything to get done.But at the same time, every human has his or her own story to tell.I’m not saying we have to take care of our own animals every day, but I am saying we have some responsibility to give them something that matters to those humans.
