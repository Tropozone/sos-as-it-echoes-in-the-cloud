  The second way to understand the relationship between the sciences and politics is to understand the limits and contradictions inherent in the system.On the one side, the sciences try to make sense of the world and then use it in their own interests.On the other, the politics of the sciences use the world as their object lesson to make sense of those interests and to be ‘the instrument’ of their own interests.How can one understand the limits of political reason?And so the third way to understand the relationships between the sciences and politics is to study in more detail how they are used as tools by the regime of forces of control.First, it is important to understand what an instrument and then the limits it is.What determines the limits for an instrument is a way of expressing their purposes.The more general phenomenon: to use an instrument means to find the limits in the things rather than to which it may be useful; to use it means to make them more general: to discover them.An object means to make them, to discover what cannot be done.Object means to explore.A thing is to discover things in order.A thing means to discover something; when the thing is one thing is an effect.A thing is to find the thing.And because it does.A thing means to make a thing is to discover the thing is a thing is an effect of the thing, it reveals what it is.
