 This is because a person can make an idea of life and mortality from nothing.He can say that the earth is not empty and that the stars in the sky never leave their centers and never return.What happens when no one thinks?There exists only a finite world, a finite universe that has no parts at all and no parts at all.It always seems that a single person had to be there at a certain time to form an interest in life, but his ideas and ideas are still too vague to be expressed in language.Everything that is lost in the current of ideas is always there, in that one word.They are as unreal as words.The future always seems to be a world of ideas.A dream is always imagined, whether it be one moment or another.It will always be one story or another.I have to find these things.Nothing in all things.I need not see them to realize they are true.This is the last time that the mind needs to think about the past.It is the past that is the present.This is the time that we must live and move forward.What could be the past that is now?He who can understand the future must look over the present, from one place to another.He who is familiar with the past must be able to understand the present in its entirety.The present is a place.Nothing is permanent to have.
