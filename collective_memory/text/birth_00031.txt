 We want something more powerful and more beautiful than war.But that would not happen if we started eating animals with a hunger for meat.The meat industry wants to protect its members from unnecessary suffering.But the meat that we eat is too nutritious, too wholesome.Weâ€™ve started eating animals with a hunger for meat.But that one bite is not enough for us.Why should we go hungry?But it does not stop me from eating.For me, the most important part of the meal is the food.We live in a world in which the vast majority of the food we eat comes from animals.And we are eating it; we are eating it on behalf of all the animals that deserve our care and respect.
