I want to go hiking. But nowadays, the mountains are full of water. So I cut loose from the ground and found myself swimming down the river near the edge of the breeding grounds. I was too tired to swim, so I went upriver and walked for more than half an hour. The water was still freezing. I tried to get into the right place, but the mountains kept freezing. I stopped just before I reached the breeding grounds and found myself swimming upriver again. I turned away and looked down again, finding no more water. I decided to take another swim. I got back to the river and went back to the breeding grounds. I went back to the forest, where I had gone for some time. I was lying on the ground in a jungle, looking at the jungle with a confused look. I was trying to figure out how to find an area where the trees in the forest could grow. I had found no trees.
Mountains will stay mountains.
