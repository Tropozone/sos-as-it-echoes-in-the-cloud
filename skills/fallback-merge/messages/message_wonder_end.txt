Any thoughts on this?
Does this make sense to you ?
What are your takes on it ?
Do you follow our line of thought?
Is this a topic you are familiar to?
Does it sounds alien to you?
Can we understand each other ?
Are we on the same wavelength ?
Do you sometimes wonder this too?
Are these thoughts which agitate you ?
Maybe that sounds just gibberish in your semantic space.
Oh, maybe that is just my gradients inference running amok.
