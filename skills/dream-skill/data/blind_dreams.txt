There was a book published, like a book of essays and the authors of these particular, essays were going to get together and do a public reading of the book, each author was going to read their one of their essays that were in the book. And I had several essays in the book and I was trying to decide which one to read. Only I was reading it in print, I was, I had to get fairly close to the page, the way I had to when I was younger to see the print, but I was reading the print book. I was trying to select an essay and I was reading bits and pieces of different essays and trying to decide. I was in I guess it was some sort of conference room, I wasn't sure what kind of room it was, it had a sort of very thick, plush, maroon carpet and large tables and really big windows. It was a really huge room.

[1997-05-08] I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said "no"... I was supposed to fly home and it was much later than I thought, and I felt really bad because I hadn't called my parents. I was walking everywhere in the house, looking for a phone.

[1997-05-09] I had a dream I was in a mall and I was shopping with my friend X from S [the club] and this guy who was with X but I don't think it was her husband. I was in a wheel chair and so was she and we were going through this store. A section of the store with lots of clothes. It wasn't all a clothes store and it had sort of the usual mall kind of lighting. And it was quiet, not too quiet, like the store was carpeted so it was not too echoey in there. For some reason I decided to walk to the next store, I was walking with my sister and we were in the next store and walking around and I realized that I left my wheel chair in the last store and someone went back to get it and then somehow we ended up, X and I were parked next to the front of the store where it goes into the mall, like this really wide area, we were just parked there in our wheelchairs and this guy who was with X, and so was my sister, said something to X and she said something back like "we'll talk about it later" and she sounded like a little kid. And I said "okay". And the guy said something to us like, "you know, you two used to be so normal until you started hanging out together." And I realized I was sucking on my hand like a little kid and I took my hand out of my mouth and felt really stupid. And X said "You should be glad, at least we survived". 

Last night I dreamed that I was talking to a person who is bringing her cat over today for a visit before she leaves him with me in his new home. The dream was really similar to our last conversation in terms of arranging the time that he was to visit, but then she asked me if I had plenty of toys and I felt disappointed because she had told me previously the cat was a quiet cat and not very playful and I said 'yes I do, but I thought that you said that he's not too playful'. That's where the dream ended.

I dreamed that a friend of mine gave me 500 dollars and took me shopping. We went into a department store and I picked out a pair of jeans and a pair of pajamas which were really fleecy the dream immediately switched over to my community chorus where one of the members told me that an older member had recently been committed to a nursing home, this is someone who is lively and fun to be with and I said 'oh that's too bad!'

I dreamed that I was coming out of the upstairs bathroom in my parents house and as I was standing out in the hallway, listening, I heard the TV blaring, and it was a news magazine like 20/20 and the topic was Job Searching. I groaned inwardly and thought 'oh great, here we go again' because now my parents were going to bring up the whole issue of finding a job. And I don't want to discuss it.

I had a dream that I was standing in a rehearsal of my community chorus for a concert and we were dancing as we were singing a mellow Carpenters number and I was relieved to find that I was following everyone else's movements and not out of step with them. Our conductor asked a friend of mine, R, a recovering anorexic, to stand up and speak some words about the disorder in the middle of a song, but she never got up and because I didn't hear her speak I thought to myself: "why is she not getting up?" and speaking the way she's supposed to be.

The Mystic River Chorale, which is my community chorus, was rehearsing in a classroom where we usually hold rehearsals on Monday nights and for some reason we began to sing Vivaldi's (Biachishpere?) and as we were singing it I looked through my folder of Braille music sheets and said "wait a minute! Its not in there, why are we singing this again, we just sang it last Christmas , this isn't appropriate for spring" and yet on second thought, I said, "Well, we'll be able to hear Tracy and Jenny sing again during the solos so that'll be good".

Last night I dreamed that I received a Braille letter from the agency that I was applying for a job with, and it said that I had been refused the job in favor of a guy named George C... I didn't know the name, because he was involved with some local political activity and other things that I knew about. I said "well that's good, he should be more suited for the job than I am" so I was glad that he got the job and not me. I was also really relieved because I really didn't want the job even though I had applied for it.

I was playing an organ at a funeral and I thought it went very well, but apparently someone was very unhappy about it because a man, and I have no idea who the man was, left the funeral home with me and we walked along a very deserted road, and it was bitterly cold. I had on my woolen winter coat which goes below mid-calf and its a very comfortable coat, but its awkward and heavy. And the wind was blowing and it was raining all of a sudden the man with me said "Run P! That car is chasing us!" We began to run, and it was very difficult for me in that coat and I tripped and stumbled, I didn't fall and the man grabbed my arm and pushed me up against a tree. He said, "stand there with your back to the road and he won't be able to see us." And it was very, very dark and the headlights of the car kept coming closer and closer and I woke up terrified and shaking like a leaf.

I was walking on a dirt road and this very peculiar fog, it was very heavy and I couldn't see the road, but my head stuck up out of the fog and I could see trees and blue sky and stars and so forth, it was like I was wading through this fog, grayish white, the sky was brilliant blue, the trees were just lovely.

I dreamed that I was with my friend A and I really don't know where we were and she was showing me pictures of herself and her family, dozens and dozens of them and after a while I was incredibly bored and I thought that she would never stop and we were beside a road and 2 boys, probably 12 to 15 years old, were pulling one of those bright red coaster wagons which were so popular when I was younger, and in these wagons were little children, 3, 4, 5 years old and they were just laughing and screaming and having a wonderful time and the bigger boys who were pulling the wagon, let go and gave them a push and my friend and I stood there frozen, not knowing what to do. It turned out okay, nothing happened to the small children.

Last night I dreamed of a sailing ship, I don't know if it was a schooner or... it was like the USS Constitution that I saw so many years ago. And I watched it sail off over the horizon, over the most beautiful bluish-green ocean and brilliant blue sky and turned around and walked away and was in some kind of field or meadow where this very, very tall lamppost with 4 lights coming out of the top of it very oddly shaped, I can't describe the shape and the lights were pointed in the 4 directions of the compass, north, south, east and west and they were on, they were bright but very, very pretty.

I dreamed that I was in Alaska on a beautiful, bright blue, stretch of water, I don't know if it was a lake or a river and I was paddling a kayak, and the front of it was about 10, or 12 feet long, and the back was equally long and I don't think I had a double bladed paddle, I think it was just a single blade like a canoe paddle and I was just moving along on this lake and it was just absolutely gorgeous.

I had another dream earlier about F again, he and I were in a room. I think, just standing and talking and all of a sudden he said, "Oh, I get it!" and he looked up and d here was this shelf with 2 hats on it, one was his and one was mine; a red baseball type cap with the Marine emblem on the front, like I bought at the PX of the [veterans hospital]. His was like a felt hat that men wear in the winter but it was made of straw and it was on top of my hat, and apparently this was a very sexual thing to him because he turned to look at me and he said "I know why you did that" and there was a sexual tension in the air and you (the researcher) walked into the room and looked at us and looked at the 2 hats and began to laugh.

I dreamed about a young lady who was a very close friend of my daughter's when they were in elementary school together, her name is L. L subsequently moved to Florida and is gay. However I dreamed that L was getting married and I don't know if I was the organist or part of the wedding party or just a guest, but all the brides maid were absolutely beautiful and L came out of the dressing room in a gorgeous bright blue wedding gown.

Not too clear, but apparently I was going to fly somewhere or had flown and had a really big, bright green suitcase and it had been stolen , and I was upset because a great many of my valuable personal items were in it. And there was an elderly lady standing by who was very sympathetic and gave me an envelope with a 100 dollar bill inside which I tried to refuse and she wouldn't listen so I took it and as I was leaving her she handed me a 50 dollar bill and rather than argue with her again, I accepted it and her name was Mildred, and I believe her husband was standing beside her and what concerned me the most and... ahh, I was going to fly out, this was at an airport, it was a long concourse, not with a lot of people around, but a few and my biggest concern was that my ID had been stolen and in that case I could not get on the plane.

I had this dream 2 or 3 nights ago that I was going to New Zealand, and we stopped off in China, I say 'we' but I have no idea who was with me, but we stopped in China and we found a McDonalds and I lost my luggage and the tickets we needed to go to New Zealand. The sites in China, or maybe Japan, it was one of the oriental countries and the sites that we saw were very typical of the sites that I've seen in magazines or on TV and stuff, I can't remember any explicit scenes.

I dreamt of a young man who used to be a very close friend of my son's, his name is R. And R and my son and my daughter were in an automobile accident, it was my son's fault, unfortunately, this is not the dream, this is real unfortunately, and R's eyes got hurt. In the dream I saw my son and he said that "R and his wife have split up" and I said "oh my. Why?" and he said "She couldn't stand his drooling." And I said, "R drools?" and he said "yeah" and I said "Well can't something be done about it ?" and my daughter jumped in and she said "he's having electrical treatments but they don't seem to help." And I said, "well, that's really too bad". And from there I went into R's mother's bathroom which was just filled with Loreal products, every conceivable product you could think of and I picked each one up and looked at it. They were all in pink bottles, and the bathroom was very lovely, I can't remember details, but these Loreal bottles were very pretty.

I was surrounded by boxes and bags of small balls of yarn which I had to sort out and that was a chore I had done many times in my life and one which I enjoy and so that was a nice dream, all different colors, some were in boxes and some were in Shop and Save bags, the local grocery chain... The I jumped from sorting balls of yarn to dress making in my mother's bedroom which had pale green curtains, the bed that she and my father slept in, and all their furniture, but I was trying to use a pattern and cut out a jacket or a blazer for myself and I cut all the pieces out and held them up and where I had folded the fabric, there wasn't enough so that the front of this jacket was very , very short and could not be used. This took place in a house in a very remote part of southern Maine called UF, a town which had a power station where my dad was the superintendent of and in this dream I looked out the bedroom window, which I often did, and I could see the power station and the Saco river behind it, its really a lovely view and it was very real in this dream and there were all kinds of construction workers who were milling around down at the power station which is called Q Dam.

Last night I dreamed that I was in someone's home in a good sized room with other people and there was a nice looking man there and somebody said that he was a doctor and I went upstairs in this house and there was an accordion on the floor and I knew that it belonged to the doctor, and I brought it downstairs and I asked the doctor if he would object to me playing that accordion and he asked me if I knew how and I said yes I did and that at one time I taught both accordion and piano. We went upstairs and I put the accordion on and he adjusted the straps and it was a beautiful instrument and it was black and white and it was definitely a man's accordion it was so big.

I had the care of a small child, I don't know if the child was mine or someone else's. In the beginning the child, a little girl, was lying on her back, very asleep, and a coverlet laying askew. I carefully placed the coverlet over her, but could not cover her feet, so I pulled it down and her shoulders were uncovered and I pulled it up and her feet were uncovered again. Then she was in a crib a very large crib and she was sitting up, laughing, she was a beautiful child, but I can't remember any details of her face or hair.

I dreamed about my younger daughter, C. In the dream she was a small child again and I was leaning out an upstairs window of an apartment where we lived apparently, and she was crossing a very busy street and I shouted down to her "C watch what you're doing!" Because she wasn't watching where she was going and the traffic was very heavy and she just said "yeah" and she bent over and picked up a banana peal and once again I shouted "don't pick up other people's garbage!" and she flaunted the banana peal, waved it around.

C and I were going to a beach and we had to walk down quite a steep incline and the path was very narrow, and between very prickly bushes, possibly holly bushes. They grabbed at our clothing and scratched our arms and legs, but it wasn't painful at all. They were very pretty glossy green leaves and red berries and the path was just wide enough for one foot so you had to place one foot directly in front of the other. We finally got down to the beach but there was no beach, there were just big rocks, and she clambered up onto a big rock, and I was just behind her and I looked out and there was a huge wave coming and I screamed "C watch out for the wave!" and she clung to her rock which she was on and which had a point on it, and the water engulfed both of us and through the water I could see her hanging onto the rock and I tried to reach her but I couldn't because the water was so powerful, and when the water subsided, she was gone and I was totally dry and I just shouted at the top of my lungs "Oh God! C come back!". I woke up very, very startled.

I was hanging up clothes for my mother and one of the pieces of cloth was one of my dad's tan workshirts. They were long sleeved and he had pants that matched them. The shirt was almost as if it had been very stiffly starched and ironed and I had a real problem hanging it on the line and one of my mothers friends was on the lawn, playing with a dog I don'' remember the size of the dog, but I was surprised that this dignified lady, this school librarian would be roughhousing with a dog and there was a small statue of Queen Victoria on a stand somewhere, and it was very nicely painted, she was not in mourning and that the most common picture you see of her... Here she was short and dumpy but she had on lovely clothes, a blue skirt and pink blouse and that's it.

[1997-05-21] I'm at work, I'm not sure where, but I'm stopping off where a conversation is taking place in. I think the third floor hallway of our wing I think. There were some people, but the only person who was speaking to me at the time was, I think, one of the other counselors named M. And he said, "You know, you don't have to be blind to learn things too" and I said "What did you say?", he repeated it and I said, "I know that."

[1997-05-04] I was walking out of some hospital because I had to have some kind of short, out patient procedure and there was a door that I was able to walk through, and I felt really good, but then it was like adjacent to my own office building and so I ended up having to be at work, about a 30 second walk from work, like in a different direction was work, in a different building. I walked into the work area and asked if someone could give me a ride because I didn't think that it was all right for me to walk home even though I felt pretty good, I didn't think that it was a good idea and they said, a lady, I think it was one of my drivers, she said "well we don't know if we can do that, we have to get approval first from somebody else". The dream seemed to end there.

[1997-05-07] I am sitting in the kitchen of my parents' house in a chair at the table. The table is on my left and the chair is to the right of it. My ,mother is trying to do my hair, she's setting my hair in a more interesting way, she's making these curls up on the top and up on each side and I'm getting ready for a trip, I'm about to take a plane I'm not sure where. We get a phone call and we get to talk to some people about things related to the trip. They're talking about Boston, so somehow that figured in too, places in Boston we go to.

[1997-05-07] I am standing next to an elderly gentleman, and we are in Italy and I think we're outside near an old, wooden, barn type structure. I'm trying to figure out how much Italian I can remember ands the only thing I can remember is Buon Giorno and so I say it to him and I shake his hand.

[1997-05-13] Visiting a friend in the hospital, F, who had hurt himself, gotten into some kind of accident, he had hurt his shoulder, and was spending a couple of days in the hospital. I went to see him and he was doing okay, so it wasn't too sad and he was making good progress and he wasn't really sick and he was going to be coming home soon and he seemed not to be in too much discomfort so I wasn't really upset about it and I thought he was getting good care and we were just talking together for a few minutes.

[1997-05-15] I am in a gymnasium of the school for the blind that I attended when I was little and its about mid-afternoon and there were a lot of people there, many of them were from other states, they were having a party and I was talking to a man there whose name I can't remember and we were supposed to start working on a project but we didn't, we were just conversing.

[1997-05-16] I was on the telephone with a person named T who is a supermarket guy who takes the orders for me when I call up to put my order in for the week, because they deliver and he was playing an organ and he wanted me to play mine so he could hear mine and I said "wait a minute" and I went over to the organ that I have at home and I was doing the different stops that it has with my left hand, and I couldn't get it to sound the way I had hoped it would , I was going for a particular vibrato and it wasn't going to that sound and I was getting frustrated because I couldn't get it to go to that certain sound quality that I was going for.

[1997-05-16] I was in church, at mass and suddenly the father stopped the mass and said "that's all I'm going to do, I'm not going to do anymore mass, I'm leaving" and he did and we all got really mad, all of us in the church and we started to say "he can't do this! We have to have mass. What would happen if all the priests did that? We'd have no more mass! It would be awful." My friend B and her mother and I were walking out and I said "you know, that's terrible, I think he just did that because he's got somewhere to go on his schedule and he just wanted to get out and do it" and B's mother said; "he's right there. He just heard everything you said" and I said "I don't care! I'm glad he heard me and I'd say it again if he wanted me to because its not fair that he did that to us." And I was real mad and didn't know what to do. We kept walking and went home and I was at the church that was across the street from the house where my parents lived when I was growing up, so we went to their house.

[1997-05-17] Its night time and I'm in NY at somebody's apartment, I was lying in bed, I had Betty next to me lying on the floor and we were watching television, listening to it anyway, it was about midnight, but then it was my aunt M and she said "lets go see H" who's my cousin, "its close enough to walk, we don't have to get in the car" but my sister didn't want me to bring Betty, and there were some kids staying there and they were sleeping and I said "no I'm bringing Betty because she'll bark whenever she's away from me and she'll keep the neighbors awake" and so I took Betty with us and the only thing we had to do to get to this cousin of mine was to go out a door, turn right, go down this other driveway thing and then there was another turn and we ended up at his house and I go "well that's not far". So then we stayed there for a while and went right back home again, back to the other lady's house and we just talked. I don't remember much about the conversation. It was nice to see them, they were happy to be together.

[1997-05-17] I'm in this thing called the Runway at Redwood, its between the dining room door and another door to the main part of the building where the classrooms were. And there are lockers and they're made out of wood and another door which leads outside. In the middle of the runway were these great big, structures made of a like Tinker Toy material almost four feet high. You could take your hand and grasp these pegs, these things and take them apart. And they said, "and you guys gotta help out because we only have 10 minutes to get this runway clear because there's going to be a lot of people coming through here, we've got to get these things taken apart." I pulled on one and it came apart pretty easily. So first I was at one end of these things trying to help out, and there were a lot of others helping too, some ladies that are head consultants that work with us. And to my surprise, I pulled on the Tinker Toy-like peg and it came out of the 2 ends it was connected on, and it came off the structure pretty easily, but I didn't have anything to put them in, so I had about 4 or 5 of them in my hands and I was trying to figure out where to put them. I started out at one end, couldn't figure out where to put them and then I went to the other end, see how long it is, how much progress people are making with this thing. It was pretty good, it was going pretty fast but the project never really ended because I woke up.

[1997-05-17] I was at a client's house in Wilmont, in her kitchen and she had apples. All different and all arranged in a little tower like thing. There were apples on top and at the bottom and I don't know if there were apples under it, somehow arranged in this type of container on her counter.

[1997-05-19] We were taking a tour of a huge school where many of the people there had problems with alcohol, drugs and other problems. People lived there too. This female high school kid was giving me a tour. She was on my right. I don't think I had my dog. I was going inside with her and so I had my right hand on her left arm. We were walking around the school and she was explaining things, we had to stop every now and again and listen to this boring speaker explain things. Then she said "Oh, remind me that I have to go to my room before we leave" so I said "okay" and I did and she went and did what she had to. She thanked me for reminding her. It was a very large building, and walking around was tiring because it was so spacious.

[1997-05-20] I was staying at some people's house I'm not sure who they were. I don't know what state but it was far away from Connecticut. I had left on a Monday and I was taking four days and I couldn't take a fifth day without a note from a doctor because I was claiming sick time. It was just a cold and I really don't think I needed to go to a doctor so I better3 go back to work on Friday. I don't know what happened, but I never did go. I remember just being at these people's house and watching TV and listening to the radio and kind of enjoying things because I wasn't that sick, I just had a little cold.

[1997-05-22] People were setting up some sort of carnival right in front of our house in the street which was blocked off. There were going to be rides and games and it was going to be really neat. I thought about the noise that would be generated and then I thought no that's okay because it would be fun to have it real close by and I wouldn't have to worry about transportation to get there so that was okay.

[1997-05-22] It was afternoon and we were at work ands I was in an office talking to a couple of teachers. One rehab teacher who doesn't always see things the way I do, someone who is not as understanding as I wish she could be sometimes with our clients. I am always frustrated with her because of this. I was frustrated in the dream as well. They were in their office, all talking and not really working very hard and others were there too. Her assistant came in and said "I'm going to watch TV." She had a TV on near her desk. I was standing in the doorway, about 2PM and she went over to her desk on the opposite side of the wall. The teacher I was trying to talk to was nearer to me. I thought it would probably be a good idea for me to leave the room because I didn't want to get caught watching TV or even being a room with a TV even though I wasn't going to be listening to it or watching it so I didn't stay very long.

[1997-05-23] I'm wearing a very pretty silk dress and I have my period, but I have protection so I am not worried about doing anything to the dress. But I always get concerned about when I have dreamt like this, because in my dream I know that I don't get it anymore because I had a hysterectomy in real life. So I always have a conflict feeling in my dream when I have it in my dream. Later I am reading a book of Braille pages, 19 to 34. It was about this girl who happened to be one of my old clients and that she was riding horses and she was doing all these sporty things, like playing football and she was totally blind and I couldn't figure out how she could do all that. Then I thought, well the article is wrong or something's strange about this magazine. In the same dream I am at this house with a great big living room, but somehow its my house and its after 4PM and you walk out of this carpetted area to a screened in porch and its really nice. The carpeting is new but there are these big square pieces of lint which are somehow there because it is new and I had to get rid of them because I was scared that my dog would try to eat them but I didn't think the vacuum cleaner was picking them up, because I had bent down and felt a couple and touched them.

[1997-05-23] I'm trying to type on a little tiny portable typewriter on my lap and I'm having all kinds of trouble because when I go to type I know its not writing. The key isn't hitting the mechanism and I'm worried about the quality of what its going top look like and I'm having all kinds of problems, and I was mad because we didn't have tables, we were all sitting in this theater style room and we didn't have tables or anything and there wasn't anything we could do about it and I was really frustrated and there were all kinds of people around and D, my boss was there and a whole lot of other people were there. I'm not sure what the situation was.

[1997-05-23] I just remembered it was night time and I was in their backyard which you have to follow around on a sidewalk which runs from their backyard to the end. I was carrying a shopping bag full of garbage to put in the garbage barrel which was way up at the top, the end of the sidewalk, and I was walking up the sidewalk independently, I didn't need to use a dog or a cane or anything. I was bringing the garbage and yet somehow I had to go back to the house to get another bag, or put it in a plastic bag, so I was going the other way first, then I went back the other way towards the barrel.

[1997-05-23] My boss was in my dream and he was saying that the first time he got married it wasn't done right and he didn't want people to have the wrong idea, in case, in the future so he was going to have a religious ceremony this time and make it better. He was talking to someone else in the room, I didn't get into it I was more of a spectator hearing him talk. We were in this brightly lit room. It was either a hotel or a conference place but we were in this really big room. It might have been the same part of the dream as the typewriter part. I think it was the same dream where we were typing.

[1997-05-27] It was lunch time, about 12ish in the afternoon and it seemed like it was a rainy day and we were walking to the cafeteria at the college where I used to work at my second job at Eastfield Community Technical College and we had to go the building where the cafeteria was and somehow my nephew was there for some reason and my very first boss that I had when I worked at [famous blind school] was also there. I don't know what we ate but we had lunch there and it was fun. Then we came back and I had a lot of paperwork to do and somehow I was at my third job and I went in my office and was working for the rest of the afternoon.

[1997-05-29] There were a whole lot of children in my house. And it was afternoon and they were cute. They were about six or seven and I was going to go up and show them my computer and one of the vendors from a place that sells computers and reading machines was in my house too and this lady was with him and we all went upstairs and I had 2 dolls on my bed in my spare room and I was touching the lace on one of my dolls and I was showing it to them, one of the collectibles I have and they liked it and then I was showing them my computer. There was a funny connection on my computer, there was this funny big wire and there was another little wire which connected with it and it didn't feel right and Curt the vendor guy said, "we can't have it like that." I was kind of relieved to have him say that it wasn't safe like that and that he was going to fix it. And the kids were getting a kick out of the talking computer.

[1997-05-29] It was raining torrents this day and I was in my house, my condo in my living room when my sister called and I said "Hi, how are you, what did you do today?" she said "Nothing, its been raining too hard" and I said "I know, I've been in bed all day today too, its just too awful out to do anything.

[1997-06-02] I was at work and there was a new lady doing my counseling job and she had been a friend of mine a long time ago and she said "yeah, I'm doing this now. I go to meet with this guy S and he tells me how to handle different things." I said "yeah, I used to do that when I first started too" but I don't do that now cause I don't have S now. And it was like I missed what she used to have because things had changed and I remember how good they were for me in the beginning and how I used to like the job and how I don't like the job anymore because I don't have S the way she did. So I said "well, that's good."

[1997-06-02] We were about to sit down to dinner and it was about 50 degrees out about 5pm and I said I can't now, I have to take Betty out. So I took Betty out and then came back and ate. A while later we were walking and Betty did something really strange, we had started to cross the street and she stopped about two thirds of the way across the street. I couldn't get her to go and I was really frustrated. I tried repeatedly to get her to go and she wouldn't go and then somebody said there's a dog on the other side of the curb, the up-curb on the left hand side eating kibble and Betty wants to get the dog's space so she can eat and I said "oh that ,makes sense then". Then we were in some kind of a store and this lady said she was going to buy some kind of shampoo for her dog, but it was a grocery store and I didn't think they had dog shampoo. I said "if you can buy dog shampoo here for your dog, maybe I can buy some for Betty too" And then we bought cards but we had to take them home first and write some stuff in it, we couldn't just give them away as they were, so somebody helped me do mine. 

[1997-06-03] We were at the house I grew up in and I had raised a big party. My 3 cousins who are brothers were there and we had cookies and shrimp salad and al kinds of stuff, but everything was together in the same area on one big counter and I was reaching and getting cookies to eat and talking in a very animated manner with my cousins about how wonderful my brother in law was and good he was to me, how he thinks of me and asks me if I need anything and I was saying "do you have brother in laws like that?" but of course they didn't answer, "as nice as mine are."

[1997-05-05] I was at Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia visiting Thomas Jefferson's house which I had already seen. I was down in the basement looking at all the clocks, a big clock that he had made. It has cannon balls on it. I guess my husband was with me. He and I were visiting and getting our own, personal tour of Monticello. We went there in 1989 with a bunch of people, but in this dream we were getting our own private tour. Going all over the mansion, up and down that winding staircase, in those rooms, looking at all the books that Jefferson had.

[1997-05-08] A strange dream. My husband and I were up at [school for blind children], it was New Years eve and they were going to have a big party but they changed the school all around. There were all people there we knew, but Pete and I weren't going to this party because we were getting ready to have our own party. The next day with Merv K. A friend of his family was going to come over on New Years day. Somehow the dream was all mixed up. I went into the ladies room there to use the ladies room and somehow our friend Joe N. was in there. I don't know why, and I don't know why we were going to this party when we were going to have our own party the next day. But Pete and I went because somebody told us we should and he and I were wearing shorts. We had shorts on instead of formal. Everyone else was dressed to kill. They all had fancy skirts and nice suits on, here comes Pete and I with our shorts on. I don't even know if it was January.

[1997-05-09] I was with some of my women friends from our Lutheran church's ladies group and we were at this big convention somewhere, probably in a church but I don't know. I was with my friend and we were selling little folders about sleep and sleep disorders. In the dream, I asked a female friend "What's on this paper?" I didn't have my scanner with me its too big. She said "Its all about sleep disorders and everything."

[1997-05-10] I was at Sears addressing envelopes for Christmas cards. They didn't care for the way I did it, because we were taught how to do it when we were in school. There was a typewriter with a correction key which was nice. I don't know which Sears I was at or why I was there.

[1997-05-26] I rescued one of the characters from "The Stand." Stu Redman and I were out in the desert. I don't know how I got there or what I was doing there but I was the one who was driving a car. Stu was telling me to go left or right, which direction to go.

[1997-05-29] Had a dream, not a very happy one. My mother came into the room and told me that my Uncle Joe from Missouri, had passed away. I don't think I was here in my house, I think I was in my old home in Ashford where I used to live and my cousin Jan was there. I got up and everybody was having coffee and doughnuts. My aunt, who has passed away in 1984 was there, and at this table with everyone else. She was a fabulous person, my dad's sister, I guess she was my favorite of all my aunts. She used to take care of me after school.

We were down in a summer camp for the blind, Mort and I and a whole bunch of other people. And for some reason we were supposed to go to someplace like Cube Island but we couldn't go because none of the vans was working. They'd all broken down, just like they did for real in 1988. I don't know how we resolved the problem in my dream.

[1997-06-03] Mort and I went down to Monticello in Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson, our 3rd president. He was there and he gave us a tour of his home. We had a chance to meet some of his family and all that. He was glad to meet us and he didn't care if we couldn't see. He even let us touch a couple of things in the home that we weren't allowed to touch when we visited there in 1990 with a tour group of blind persons from [an agency for the blind]. I thought that was pretty cool. He let us touch that big clock down in the basement. He took us into his gardens to see his plants. He told us about them and his travels through Europe and everywhere.

[1997-06-05] I guess I died in this dream because I went to heaven and I was surrounded by this gigantic Angel Choir, singing different hymns, things you see when you die, in fact they had me try out and I was so good that they had me become part of the choir. I guess we had good times if you can say that angels have good times. At least I knew I was on the side of the good guys and not down in Hell with the devil.

[1997-06-07] On the show "A Prairie Home Companion" (weekly radio comedy show) they must have had a contest where you send in tapes and then they would judge you from there and the winners would go on the show. So, our friend DD who is also blind, and plays piano at many of the night clubs in our area and he was one of the winners. They told him that he could invite some other people to fly out to Minneapolis and be on the show with him, so he chose Mort and I. Maybe because we've been friends for so long. He just gave us a call one day and asked us how we would like going out and meeting Garrison Keilor after the show. That was really cool. We went out there and listened to him play and we did meet Garrison Keilor I think. That was it.

[1997-06-08] Another wild dream. Mort and I were traveling somewhere and there were people from MFB there, people from the council, but the married couples couldn't stay together and we all had little charms or beepers on so they could tell where we were. Where we were traveling, I have no idea but it was scary because they were playing all this country music on the bus, God was it scary!. 

[1997-06-12] I was going to the beach, which I am, and before going there, I usually have dreams about it. I didn't have any sneakers or shoes to wear so I had to do some shopping. I don't know where I went shopping or whether or if I found any shoes.

[1997-06-22] I was with this group of people up in Vermont somewhere but I didn't know who they were. We were just sitting around talking. I didn't know who they were or where they came from or anything. I was in Vermont recently with only 12 people and in the dream there seemed to be around 50.

[1997-06-23] [A day dream] Mort was on the computer, which he was when I woke up. My mother came and said "come on upstairs. I want you to try this dress on." I put the dress on. It had a zipper and a belt and this thing that snapped and it hung down the back. I never saw a dress like it. My father in law and his wife came in. They had a whole bunch of groceries. I guess my dad went out and he came in, and he must have gone shopping for us because he had groceries too. We didn't know where to put them all, the groceries that is.

I'm on a train, taking a trip. When I got on I had several pieces of luggage with me. When the trip was over I got up and attempted to get my luggage down but all the suitcases were gone and my stuff was scattered all up and down the luggage rack. I had to run up and down the aisle collecting my clothes in a garbage bag.

I have screws in my arm, the arm that is in the cast, where the bones are being fused. One day the screws came loose and fell out. When I called the doctor, she told me that the insurance company would not pay for their replacement so I went down to the basement and took a screwdriver and put them back in myself. I called the doctor to tell her and we started laughing and the doctor said that I would be welcome to work on Mondays, putting screws in peoples' arms.

I am at a social club that I belong to listening to a woman that I know, a very poor reader who always screws up names and mentions people on lists who have been dead for years. She is reciting poetry to the room which is full of people who are all in wheelchairs. She is reciting the poetry very badly and everyone is so bored that they leave, except for me. I stay and listen to her.

[1997-06-07] My dad had passed away a few years ago and this was the anniversary of his death. I dreamed that he spoke to me, I did not touch him. I was lying in bed and my father spoke in his quiet, somewhat gravely voice and just told me to keep doing my best in things and to keep watching out over my family and things to make sure things were going all right because he could only look from afar.

[1997-06-09] I was contacted by The Guiding Dogs via tape and letter. I was sitting at my hard maple, dining room table in my living room, reviewing my mail. I could feel the sun falling on my face and it felt warm and good. I listened to the tape on a tape recorder and it said that it was time for me to get another guide dog. I didn't want to do this because my guide dog is healthy. I contacted them in this dream and asked them why it was necessary for me to go back for another when Sammy was healthy and they just said because I needed one. I didn't want to go back. I dreamed that I went back and it was so real because they gave me this new guide dog who was huge and I'm not this tall and they told me his name and I told them that I didn't want this dog.

[1997-06-11] I was at a religious retreat, sitting in a dining room eating dinner. There were roses on the table, I smelled their fragrance. We had a thanksgiving type dinner with my favorite things, turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and my favorite kind of dessert, pumpkin pie. And it was in the middle of Spring which is most ironic.

[1997-07-22] I was in a large room I had never been in before. It was carpetted, it had really comfortable chairs, nice, soft, and I had been told to give a speech about some scientific topic. I delivered it, woke up and wondered how I could deliver such a speech when science is not my forte.

[1997-06-23] I was on a farm, it was springtime, there was a warm breeze blowing on my face, the sun was shining, I could feel it on my eyes and on my shoulders. I was riding a horse. The horse had that thick mane, that you could touch, with that hair that is sometimes on the coarse side. It had that very strong scent that horses have, you could smell the pungent hay as well and I was also inhaling the fresh warm air as I rode on this horse on this farm, and I was feeling relaxed and happy because I had nothing to worry about.

[1997-06-24] I was at my grandmother's house and I was feeling happy because I was in her kitchen. It was cold outside, the snow was falling. I guess I had gone outside just before I went into the kitchen because I remember the snowflakes kind of falling on my eyelashes and falling on my hair, my hair was wet. I went into her kitchen and she was baking my favorite kind of cookie which was chocolate chip and asking me if I wanted to help her bake cookies and I always enjoyed doing that because it meant that we would be sharing them with other people. So I was sitting there baking cookies with my grandma in her kitchen and just feeling really good about this until I awoke and realized that I had to get up and go back to work.

[1997-06-27] I was in a great big store. But it wasn't a department store it was filled with music boxes. Small ones that played little tunes, and the ones I've always wanted to listen to and maybe buy, the big antique music boxes that had these disks that you could play and have several different tunes on them. I was just listening to those music boxes letting the music kind of surround me and hear the different sounds, the bell-like sounds, the different kinds of music box sounds you can hear... and not only did this shop have music boxes, but it also had all kinds of great things that had music inside them. They had musical clocks, it had a music clock that had a talking announcement before the time of alarm in the morning. It talked so that I could set the alarm myself. They had a radio which gave you the choice of regular music and music box music. There were just all kinds of music boxes there. I reached into my purse because I decided that I wanted to buy some of the music boxes and nothing was inside there, no money and no credit cards to pay for them. I woke up feeling kind of ridiculous.

[1997-07-02] I was in college again. It was summer and instead of enjoying the beach, or sitting outside reading or going for a walk, I was stuck in a hot un-airconditioned classroom. We were reading Shakespeare and my books on tape hadn't come. I had a small tape recorder with a built in mic in my hand and the tape was moving, I could hear the motor and feel it moving. We were all yawning because it was so hot and the professor never came and so we left. I walked out of the classroom, into a hall and outside into the warm sunlight.

[1997-07-04] I was visiting my sister in Stamford. She has a nice little house, not far from the beach. I walked down to the beach with Sammy and my sister and my 3 little nephews. I could smell the salt air and I could hear the ocean's waves. I could hear the seagulls as they made that mournful cry, while they're either looking for pray or whatever seagulls do. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, on my shoulders. It felt warm, I kicked off my shoes and picked them up so that I would have them layer and began walking barefoot through the sand. I felt the warm sand between my toes and I felt happy, until I heard a firecracker. The firecracker was awfully close to me and it was very loud, my ears were ringing, I was afraid Sammy had gotten hurt. Luckily the firecracker had missed me this time, but I jumped or jerked a little bit and woke up.

[1997-07-08] We had a violent thunderstorm. Sammy has hated them ever since I got hurt by a firecracker. Any kind of loud clapping noise or banging noise like that. That low type sound bothers her. I was telling her to be a good girl and to stay on her rug, then we heard a really loud clap of thunder, the kind that sounds like it hit another object and it sounds like something might catch fire, its really loud and shakes everything and echoes through the air. Well, Sammy disobeyed me and leaped onto my bed, so I had about 70 pounds of dog on top of my stomach. I told her to get off my stomach, to get down, then she started to dig her little claws and paws into me to hold onto me. They were really sharp and it actually hurt a little bit. She wouldn't get down. I jerked awake to discover that it had been thundering and there was Sammy on top of my stomach and she wouldn't get down.

[1997-07-09] I fell asleep and then heard both of my toilets, upstairs and on this floor, having some problems. I heard all this water going all over the floor, both upstairs and downstairs and all kinds of stuff coming out which smelled kind of gross. The water was going everywhere, I couldn't remember where the shut off switch or faucet on the pipe was on either of the toilets and I felt I was going to drown in it.

[1997-07-13] I was back at Guiding Dogs again although Sammy was still alive, she just couldn't guide anymore. I don't know if she couldn't or wouldn't because she was just tired of it and so I was getting a new dog. They gave me this huge dog, I think the person said it was a "Masty" dog, but I believe the correct word is a Mastiff. It was a huge dog and I was disappointed because I didn't want a huge dog, they're hard when you take them on buses and things. I told the instructor. "I really don't want that kind of dog." And they said "Okay, we'll give you another one." And they happened to have another like Sammy, another Chocolate Lab. I remember training with the dog and then coming home and then I introduced Sammy to the dog and they were friends and I woke up.

[1997-05-30] I was in some kind of cafeteria like thing, there were tables and chairs, like you would find at a church or something and the cafeteria was echoey and there were 2 nuns there. One nun was sister Kate and I could hear in her voice, she was trying to persuade me to teach class and the other nun, possibly sister Gert a nun from Ireland and she said I've got to get what your assignment is, I'm going to go into a box and draw your assignment. Whatever paper you draw, that's what you'll be teaching and in my dream I could definitely hear voices, echoes, but there are no bodies. They're like spirit. When she hands me something there are no bodies, no arms or hands. When she said I'm going to go get your assignment, I didn't hear her foot steps, she just disappeared and it was like a spirit.

[1997-06-06] A nightmare more or less I was sleeping and I felt somebody staring at me and I jumped and I sat straight up in bed and thrust my hands out to push away whoever was staring at me but of course there was nobody there. My feet were off the side of the bed. I don't know how to describe the staring sensation, you know how you can just feel it sometimes when someone is staring at you?

[1997-06-08] I was in a repair garage somewhere in the woods somehow it got in the woods. Its not like its echoey...you could smell a lot of, burning smell. Not like gas, but like the tar on a telephone pole, I don't know if its called tar or creosote. My brother Sam was there, I guess it was his car in the garage and he said "Well I can't see anything burning." And I said "Well I can smell it." And I said "Well, we've got to get out of here." There were a bunch of other people, some were blind and some that weren't and finally when the smell got too much, we all ran and he said "Well, I'll get you to where the woods meets the edge of the road." He leaves the dream but somehow gets us to the edge of this road I don't know how I knew the car was in the garage, I just sensed it. It wasn't a color or a specific size, I just knew that it was in there and was burning up.

[1997-06-08] I'm with people. I don't quite recognize all of the people. There is some kind of religious person there, not necessarily a priest or a minister, but it was somebody who prays anyway. He was asking me a bunch of questions and then said "Its election time and Tom Tailor, a blind person and friend of mine said to me "He is no longer the chair person of this group, you are and you have to run the meeting and ask the questions... but I didn't know what kind of meeting it was, it wasn't a blind meeting, it was kind of festive with soda and coffee and party snacks and drinks Again, no body figures, only spirit figures.

[1997-08-11] I was with two people whom I could not identify. It was mainly conversation with two people but I don't know what we were talking about. It was a couple. I was in this place, nothing necessarily familiar although I had a job and this couple was telling me what I had to do. I had to go up to the top floor, and in reality I am petrified of elevators and so I told them that I would take the stairs and they said, "You don't want to take the stairs because they're in worse shape than the elevators." But I decided I would take the stairs and It was some sort of four day work thing. As I climbed the stairs, they started off fine, but as I climbed higher, the stairs became more and more rickety and shaky and wobbly and I was thinking "Oh my God, what are they going to be like when I get to the real top?" And then somewhere in all of this I realized that I had to be in Washington DC in two days although the job was supposed to be four days. The couple sort of leaves. My friend who usually drives me to Washington DC came into my dream. I thought "How do I get down? I'm in the middle of these rickety stairs and I either have to go up and complete the job and miss Washington or I start on down and although I don't remember climbing down the stairs, I must have because I remember asking my driver if he would take me to Washington.

I am walking over some difficult terrain, up a hill, over rocks etc. There are always 2 ways to deal. Jesus is there pulling me, assisting me with the difficult way and the devil is there too, guiding me toward a much easier, pleasanter route; fields of flowers and cool breezes, paved paths and so forth. The odd thing is, both Jesus and the devil look alike in the dream. Their faces are both smooth, unlined, clean shaven, like a baby's cheeks. They sometimes are pulling in opposite directions but there is no hostility or violence. I would always wake up just as I noticed their similarity.

[1997-06-06] I dreamed of a married couple that I really know and they were visiting in my home. I was sitting with a lady Peggy and Donald, I could hear in another room something about how he would like a cold beer and I realized that all of the beer that I had in the house was warm and I did say to Peggy "Did she mind if I asked Don to go to the store and just get some cold beer?" She got so upset! To console her I reached out to stroke her hair. It was long, I could feel it, and it was permed and my feeling in the dream was complete puzzlement at her reaction to a simple request about the store.

I was trying to shut off my TV that I use everyday. I could feel the buttons, very distinctly, all push buttons, and the darn thing wouldn't shut off. I was alone in the room although I could hear my son's voice over in another room. The frustrating thing was I kept pushing the off button and the TV simply wouldn't shut off. 

[1997-06-30] I dreamed I was visiting a young couple, Carl and Brandy, they were just married in May so they're still young honeymooners and while I was visiting there they proceeded to have their first argument. I could tell they were beginning an argument so I decided to leave for a while and give them the privacy that I thought they should have to take care of whatever was troubling them but I fully intended to return later on because I had been invited to dinner and I was going to come back and eat dinner. I don't know how I stay so small with all the eating I do in my dreams. 

[1997-07-01] I was a candidate for the witness protection program and I dreamed that I was being relocated to California. I was extremely upset and sobbing hysterically because of the thought of never seeing friends or family again. The morning of the day that I was supposed to leave, for some reason I was up, stripping beds. I could feel the sheets in my hands, once I bent down and touched a bare mattress. But then I paused and realized that I didn't even know what was expected of me, why was I stripping beds? I don't even know what I am supposed to be bringing with me.

[1997-07-07] A very long time friend, Jack, had picked me up at point A and gave me a ride to point B, but point B was not home it was someone else's home. But then Jack left and this person was a stranger to me. Seemed like a young man, I didn't feel awfully uncomfortable because I didn't feel afraid, he seemed to be very welcoming to both my son and I. But I was confused. I didn't know why I was there. I didn't know why Jack hadn't just brought me home. That was it.

[1997-07-08] I was holding a waste basket and I was picking up trash from the front porch and front lawn. Pieces of rolled up newspaper, paper I was putting it into this basket and from this basket I poured it into a cardboard carton because it was trash day, the barrels were out by the curb and I was going to put this box and all into the barrel. But then I realized that the trash truck was already there and because of our method of pick-up which involves the hydraulic arms where they pick up the whole barrel and dump it into the truck, I was concerned that it would be unsafe for me to go over there and drop this box into the barrel. Then I heard someone outside of the truck who let me know that it would be perfectly safe to do it and I did.

[1997-07-17] I was dreaming that I was going to a wedding in the afternoon, but that evening, in the dream, I was also going to be attending a play with several family members, but boy, I realized that was going to be a pretty busy day to get through and I did offer a rebate of my ticket at least if for some reason it wasn't used, so evidently I thought that attending 2 things in one day was going to be a lot. 

[1997-07-20] I found a plate of partially eaten food. I found it on the floor of a room where we normally wouldn't eat. I believe it was my son's little toy room. There was the plate with the food, I knew it was left over, and I simply picked it up walked to the wastebasket in the kitchen and scraped the plate. 

[1997-07-24] That family next door, that had moved away, were back for another visit. Sally, the mother had come up to say hello to me. She greeted me with a kiss, I was very happy to see her, and she did tell me that they had repurchased the house next door as a second home. She began to discuss things. They had done quite a bit of traveling, something about how many miles they had covered, they had been as far south as Alabama and now they were going to return to where they lived now which was in Maine. 

[1997-07-30] I was in a large building, it was very similar and may have even been a building on the grounds of my childhood school for the blind, where for some of my youthful years, that was my dormitory. I was there things were in quite a bit of disorder, my reason for being there, again, was a meeting that I was supposed to be attending. I left the building and outside I was walking either through melted snow or puddles of rain. I was also aware that walking around those grounds were quite a few people, there were young adults, there were children and there were even people in state politics. 

I am talking to my father on the telephone. In reality my father died this past Spring. His death hit me very hard. In this dream I was talking too him on the telephone, and I said to him "where are you?" and he said "I'm in Shreveport Hospital" Shreveport Hospital is about 20 minutes away from us but is not the hospital we use. I said to him "what are you doing there?" and he said " The police found me in the street and they brought me to Shreveport hospital." And I said to him, "If you're in Shreveport Hospital, then who is that man we buried?" And he started to laugh and he said "I don't know, but its not my problem." The main sense that I used in that dream was hearing, talking and listening to him on the telephone and holding the telephone, I could feel the receiver in my hand. (156 words)
#125-04 (F-C-T-44/44)

I am in a car with my friend Mark. Mark is totally blind and so am I. The interesting thing about this is that I am driving the car. I am driving the car from somewhere to my house. I don't know how I seem to know where to go, but I seem to know. I told him that I am going to drive us home and I'm doing it. I always wished that I could drive although this is the first dream I have ever had where I'm doing it. The main senses I used in this were hearing because I could listen to him and hear what he was saying, I could hear the other traffic around me. And feeling. I could feel the upholstery around me in the car, the steering wheel. I was driving the car, that's all there is to that dream.

I had a dream of a friend of my father's whose been very kind to me since my father died, I'll call him Jim [not his real name]. In the dream I was laying in bed, I was with Jim, he had his arms around me, and he kept saying, "Oh, its so good to have you back in my arms again." That's all that he kept saying. It was funny, because it wasn't a sexual dream, it was more a comfort dream, it was comforting to be with him and the senses I used were three of course; hearing, I could hear him talking to me, touch, I could feel his arms around me, and the mattress and the bedding, and smell, I could smell his cologne. It was not sexual, it was comfortable, peaceful, I enjoyed being with him.

I dreamt that I was typing medical reports at work which is what I do. Sitting at the desk listening to the doctor's dictation, with the headphones in my ears. I was typing a report about a woman who had twins. The woman's first name was Tina and she had a cesarean section and she had twins. I was talking to my friend Louise whom I work with, I was mentioning that this lady had twins and I was typing, and all of a sudden, somehow, and don't ask me how it happened, I ended up upstairs in the hospital bed, and I was the one who had had the twins! Twin boys and I named them Kyle and Kevin. I don't know how I got to typing at my desk to being the one who had the twins, but that's what happened in the dream. The senses I used in this dream were primarily hearing; I could hear the typewriter typing, the dictation, Tina talking to me, and upstairs I could hear the babies crying, and the nurse talking to me. I was laying in bed, I could feel the bed, earlier I felt myself sitting at my desk, and typing. It was strange but pleasant

Dreamt about my dad again. In this dream we were having a big argument. I think I told you that in reality my mother has Alzheimer's disease, she was just recently diagnosed, there have been a lot of problems with her short term memory and forgetting things, leaving doors open instead of locking them and things like that. In this dream I had a big argument with my father and I said "How can you leave me with this?!" I was so mad because I thought that he had left me to deal with this and he said "I guess you'll just have to deal with it the best you can!" And that's what he would have said. Basically the sense I used in this dream was hearing, we were shouting, we were arguing back and forth with each other. I don't exactly know where we were. We were standing in a room facing each other and yelling at each other, so I could feel myself standing like I normally can. It wasn't a very pleasant dream but it had a sense of reality to it.
