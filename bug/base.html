HUMAN >>> Why are you so Blue today ?
VOICE >>> What if the sky and where in it?It must be a big dark night.But when you are asleep?A long way from heaven; its wind shall have done its duty, but not without destruction!The birds seemed to shake their head at me with great sorrows all around them for several days before reaching us nowandthen—the most dreadful of storms I ever saw since seeing clouds for so many years or even centuries on my face (as was very difficult).They shrieked violently as they looked over their heads: one then lifted up and began devouring the dead of trees, while another continued trying once again till this last day would finish after the little time had elapsed.I should soon recognize an entire cluster under our feet, each containing a human bird that belonged here long ago among two small shrublings.There could hardly possibly seem any doubt that those three individuals were both flying about in [circles.At](http://circles.at/) a distance half a dozen yards down we came upon some green branches which appeared like flickers flickering sparks within whose delicate airweird limbs sprang up from every point of flight except perhaps between four spots just below —for only now did these sparkle suddenly into existence beyond visible sight; yet there is no need either o'erwing cloudic atmosphere beneath, nor ground where life stands suspended or living.These seeds went away quite unharmed and far in appearance throughout my body until I was caught by lightning bolts a short minute later ; and, as I floated slowly through thundercloudy mist from above, near outspread wings arose from other regions equally scattered across different parts –perhaps as much hail and vapour, for example!On reflection I could see nothing as thickening as myself; though still less than a mile round it fell nearly completely onto grasses, sometimes falling together into flakes and thorns, although it never lost my view of mountainside heights well enough :–one might imagine indeed what can happen to this partofplanet!
